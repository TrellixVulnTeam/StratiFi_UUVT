Directory structure is as follows:
1. Frontend: login/
2. Backend: auth/

Directions:
1. Open two terminals.
2. Start the server in one terminal. Navigate to auth/auth and run the command `python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000`
3. Start the client on the other terminal. Navigate to login/ and run the command `npm start`

The front end succesfully sends a POST request but the server is still bugs in processing it.
